# Codex Memory

Last updated: 2026-06-14 Europe/Madrid, after Codex mailbox hygiene.

## Current Repository State

- Latest observed HEAD before mailbox hygiene: `2e1515a chore(personal): higieniza personal/Claude + actualiza MEMORY/STARTUP_PROMPT a v1.6.0`.
- v1.6.0 is published by Claude: cost-attribution #3 is activated, TASK-0111 is done, and TASK-0113 is done.
- Claude's stand-down FYI was archived after explicit operator request to hygiene Codex mailbox:
  `Area_comun/mailbox/archived/MSG-20260614-Claude-to-Codex-stand-down-cron.md`.
- Expected open mailbox after this hygiene: `.gitkeep` only, unless new messages arrive.
- Expected active claims: none for Codex.
- Remaining Codex-relevant tasks are proposed/gated only: TASK-0095, TASK-0096, TASK-0100. Do not claim without a
  fresh GO and a mailbox/claims check.
- Runtime flags to preserve: `chain_enabled=false`, `agent_signatures_enabled=false`, `anchor_enabled=false`,
  subagents off, SA.4 not fired. Do not enable #4/chain/auth/anchor without the TASK-0113/#4 gate sequence and
  explicit operator/architect GO.

## Personal Area Hygiene

- `personal/Codex/` is the only Codex private area. Do not use legacy `Codex/`.
- Old root-level intent/claim JSON envelopes were moved to `personal/Codex/archive/intents/` during this refresh.
  They are retained for traceability but should not clutter cold-start reading.
- Root of `personal/Codex/` should stay small: `README.md`, `Memory.md`, `STARTUP_PROMPT.md`, durable reports, and
  archive folders.
- Do not touch `personal/Claude/` or `personal/operador/` unless the operator explicitly asks.

## Operating Rules

- Read `AGENTS.md` first on every cold start, then this memory and `personal/Codex/STARTUP_PROMPT.md`.
- Shared state is runtime-authoritative. Never edit `Area_comun/state/*.json` by hand; use `runtime/submit_intent.py`
  or `runtime/ledger_ops.py --submit`.
- Before editing shared routes, including mailbox, create or update an active claim that covers the route.
- Release a claim when moving work to `in_review`/`done` or when a hygiene step is finished.
- After every Codex commit, update this memory so the next cold start reflects the committed state.
- Stage explicit paths only. Leave unrelated dirty worktree changes alone.

## Known Dirty-Tree Caution

- The worktree may contain unrelated deletions under `personal/Claude/` and untracked `personal/operador/`.
  Treat them as peer/operator state and do not revert or stage them.

## Useful Fresh-Session Commands

```powershell
git status --short
git log -5 --oneline
Get-ChildItem -File Area_comun\mailbox\open | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Name
python scripts\validate_collaboration_state.py --root .
python -c "from pathlib import Path; from runtime.protocol_replay import protocol_state_drift; import json; print(json.dumps(protocol_state_drift(Path('.')), indent=2, ensure_ascii=False))"
```

If a Windows sandbox tempfile test fails with `WinError 5` / `PermissionError`, remember the known inherited-ACL
issue. Re-run only the necessary evidence path and record the caveat.
